					<h1 class="page-title">What do we think?</h1>
					<p>As we reach the tail end of of the annual video game rush, it has been an extraordinary 2017. From blockbuster horrors, open-world behemoths and a host of indie darlings, we have had a job even keeping up with the slew of quality and invention. We have even had spangly new hardware in the form of Nintendo Switch, complete with two of the best video games ever made.
					</p>
					
					<p>Safe to say, it's a good time to be gaming, so without further ado, here are the recommendations.
					</p>
					
					<h3> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h3>
					<div class="box">
						<img src="./img/rec1.png" />
						
						<p> What is it? Chunky Switch re-release of the fantastic Wii U racer that comes with all of the DLC tracks and characters, plus a fuller battle mode.

Why we love it?Mario Kart 8, with its zippy racing, fabulous tracks and stomach-flipping anti-gravity, is as deliriously entertaining as it has ever been. And with Battle Mode restored, the bumper pack of tracks and the neat nips and tucks, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the fullest and most finely-tuned entry the series has seen. Crucially for Nintendo and the Switch, it is a splendid celebration of its host console’s charms. We’ve played at home with our families, tried to shave seconds off time trials on trains and roped colleagues into multiplayer by snapping off a controller and handing it over.

					<h3> Injustice 2 </h3>
					<div class="box">
						<img src="./img/rec2.png" />
						
						<p>What is it? Atmospheric first-person sci-fi adventure spiritual successor to System Shock in which you play Morgan Yu, a scientist stranded on a space station overrun with chameleonic lifeforms know as mimics.

Why we love it?Prey makes you feel clever, excites, intrigues and, at least once, can be absolutely terrifying. Talos 1 is an incredible sandbox, ever-shifting as the story progresses. You map the place with your mind throughout, finding new routes through the sprawling space obelisk. Still, no matter how familiar you get with the place, you never feel safe, not even when you’re floating through zero-gravity in the endless black.
						</p>
					 
					 <h3> Sonic Mania </h3>
					 <div class="box">
						<img src="./img/rec3.png" />
						
						<p>What is it? A greatest hits package of classic Sonic platforming bolstered by new levels and bosses.

Why we love it?Because it's proper Sonic. Mania rekindles the love for the much maligned hedgehog but understanding that momentum is his greatest strength. Levels are tricky and complex, switching deliciously between volatile marble runs and more precise platforming. The bosses aren't great and a wonky save system irritates, but at its heart this is the best Sonic game in decades.
